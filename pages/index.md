title: Neurodivergent-friendly Workspace Manifesto
---

# Preamble

In a world designed for neurotypical people, we advocate for a workplace that recognizes, values, and promotes the unique strengths and challenges of all brains. We believe that neurocognitive diversity — from ADHD to autism to dyslexia and other neurodivergent conditions — benefits innovation, creativity, and progress in all professional contexts.

# Our Principles

## 1. Recognize Neurodiversity as a Strength

We acknowledge that neurodivergent people bring unique cognitive abilities and perspectives:
- Creative thinking outside the box and unconventional problem-solving approaches
- Hyperfocus and deep specialization
- Pattern recognition abilities and attention to detail
- Persistence and passion for interest-driven work

## 2. Create Accessible Work Environments

We call for a redesign of work environments to make them accessible for neurodivergent employees:
- Flexible working hours and locations
- Self-determination over working methods and approaches
- Low-stimulation retreat spaces and options for sensory regulation
- Transparent communication structures and clear expectations

## 3. Establish Neuroinclusive Leadership

Leaders must be trained to support neurodiverse teams:
- Individualized support instead of standard procedures
- Results-orientation instead of micromanagement
- Appreciation of different communication styles
- Focus on strengths rather than deficits

## 4. Promote Diversity in Recruitment

The hiring process must consider neurodivergent candidates:
- Alternative application paths beyond the traditional interview
- Recognition of unconventional career paths and qualifications
- Assessment based on actual skills and achievements
- Specific support during the onboarding phase

## 5. Ensure Psychological Safety

We advocate for a culture where neurodivergent employees are safe:
- Respectful handling of disclosure or non-disclosure
- Zero tolerance for discrimination and stigmatization
- Active measures against burnout and overwork
- Promotion of peer support networks

## 6. Support Continuous Learning and Adaptation

The industry must be ready to learn and adapt:
- Regularly solicit feedback from neurodivergent employees
- Share and establish best practices
- Collaboration with neurodiversity experts and associations
- Provision of professional development opportunities on neurodivergent topics

# Call to Action

We call on all actors in the working world — from employees to leaders, from small businesses to international corporations — to join this movement and actively contribute to a neuroinclusive future.

We commit to:
- Actively promoting neurodiversity in our teams and organizations
- Spreading knowledge and awareness of neurodivergent needs
- Advocating for systemic changes
- Practicing mutual support and continuous learning

In a neuroinclusive workplace, we will all be more successful.
